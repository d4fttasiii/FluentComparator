# FluentComparator

## Synopsis

FluentComparator is a .NET library which allows you compare generic objects effectively. 
It makes it easy to exclude certain properties from the comparison process and it can return the list of differences. 
The library was built with the Fluent interface in mind as the name suggests. It uses reflection to retrive the public properties and serializes them before comparing.
